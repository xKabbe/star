# About Us

Welcome to the Star Project!
We are a dedicated team of two hobbyists on a mission to design, build, and launch a high-altitude weather balloon capable of collecting and analyzing environmental data.
Our project blends creativity, engineering, and data science to bring this ambitious goal to life.

Through this journey, we aim to:

* Build and prototype a robust balloon design.
* Test various hardware configurations and sensors.
* Capture and visualize atmospheric data using real-time dashboards.
* Share our findings, tools, and techniques with the community.

Our documentation is open-source and intended to be as helpful as possible to anyone interested in high-altitude balloon projects, data collection, or engineering design.
We hope our project can inspire others and provide a helpful resource for similar pursuits!
